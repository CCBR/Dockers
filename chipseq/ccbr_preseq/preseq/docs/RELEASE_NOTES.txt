preseq beta release 2.0.0 (October 29, 2014)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Notable changes in preseq software:

  * Include the module bound_pop.  This module constructs a 
    nonparametric moment-based estimator of species richness,
    the total number of species or classes in the population.


preseq beta release 1.0.3 (December 15, 2014)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Notable changes in preseq software:

  * Include defect mode to extrapolate without testing for
    defects.


preseq beta release 1.0.2 (Aug 25, 2014)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Notable changes in preseq software:

  * Included gc_extrap option to predict genomic coverage for
    single cell sequencing experiments.

  * Changed the method of finding optimal continued fraction
    to improve performance for high variable (e.g. RNAseq)
    libraries.


preseq beta release 0.0.3 (Aug 5, 2013)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Notable changes in preseq software:

  * Prediction of the complexity curve is done using the observed data
    when possible.  Previous versions bootstrapped the histogram and
    used the median estimate.  Bootstrapping is only done to compute
    confidence intervals.

  * Addition of quick mode option with flag -Q.  The complexity is 
    predicted with the observed data and bootstrapping is not done,
    speeding up the computation time tremendously.

  * Fixed a bug associated with the unistd.h header for GCC versions
    4.7+.  

  * Extensively updated the manual with examples and FAQ


preseq beta release 1.0.2 (Aug 25, 2014)

------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Functions for input in header file load_data_for_complexity

  * Fix samtools linking problem
