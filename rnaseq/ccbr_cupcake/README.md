# cDNA_Cupcake

Creating a virtual environment for cDNA_Cupcake.

### One-time site installation

The steps directly below only need to be run once to install Cupcake on your target system.
Once installed the virtual enviroment will only need to be activated prior to running
any of Cupcakeâ€™s commands.

```bash
# Cupcake requires python >= 3.7
module load python/3.8

# Initialize virtual environment
python -m venv .env

# Activate the env
source .env/bin/activate

# Upgrade the to the latest version of pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Clone the github repo
git clone https://github.com/Magdoll/cDNA_Cupcake.git
cd cDNA_Cupcake/

# Install requirement packages for setup.py
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install Cython

# Install cDNA_Cupcake
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
PATH=$PATH:${PWD}/sequence/
```

### Run cupcake after installing on target system

As mentioned above, the steps above only need to be run once. This is to install
cupcake on your target system. Once cupcake is install, a user can activate and run
cupcake using the following steps:

```bash
# If the virtual env is not activated
# assumes you are in the same directory as the virtual environment
# If not in the same dir, prefix the activate with the absolute PATH to the virtual
# environment. (i.e. source /path/to/virtual/environment/.env/bin/activate)
source .env/bin/activate

# You may need to add this to your $PATH: sequence/ directory in cDNA_Cupcake repo
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/github/repo/install/cDNA_Cupcake/sequence

# Run whatever cupcake commands you need for your analysis
<run your cupcake commands>

deactivate
```
